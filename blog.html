            <h2>Post 2: What personality traits may be holding you
                back in your studies / career?</h2>
            <p>I believe that one of the main traits that could affect my studies or career is my tendency to
                procrastinate, which in quite
                a few situations had me overworking and sitting awake at night trying to finish a task. But that is
                something I work on.

            <h2>Post 3:How can you turn your strengths /
                weaknesses into opportunities?</h2>
            <p>My desire to learn new things could be very helpfull in an environment like IT where inovations never
                seem to stop. Also I
                can learn how to better manage my time so I can finish a task without overworking myself.

                succeeding in your studies / career?</h2>
            <p>Probably adapting to the new method of studying because I find it difficult to change my way of working,
                but it will certainly not stop me from advancing in my career.
